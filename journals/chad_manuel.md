## What was worked on?

- Today we worked on finalizing our pydantic models and finishing the api endpoints
- We had some instructor input to help us decide on which database we’re using for the project
- We had each group member make a simple api request to test out which database we would like to use and will talk about it more tomorrow.
- I worked on mongodb with fast api, setting up the database was nice and smooth, having some difficulties setting up a list view though but I just need more practice with fastapi to get what else I’m missing.
